I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Computer Science](http://cs.au.dk/) at Aarhus
University under [Lars Birkedal](http://cs.au.dk/~birke). I am presently at Oxford
University as a visiting researcher. Have a look at my [cv](/cv.pdf) or this [photo](/photo.jpg).

I study programming languages, type theories, and logics. I am particularly interested in applying
semantic methods to prove syntactic properties of modal type theories and programming languages. I
am also involved in the development of program logics for concurrent programming languages through
the [Iris](http://iris-project.org) project.

[Carlo Angiuli](https://carloangiuli.com/) and I are currently working on a book on dependent type
theory. An early draft of the manuscript is available here: [Principles of Dependent Type
Theory](./papers/type-theory-book.pdf).
