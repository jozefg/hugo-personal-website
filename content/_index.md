I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Computer Science](http://cs.au.dk/) at Aarhus
University under [Lars Birkedal](http://cs.au.dk/~birke). I am presently at Oxford
University as a visiting researcher and will start as an assistant professor at Aarhus University in
the spring of 2025. Have a look at my [cv](/cv.pdf) or this [photo](/photo.jpg).

I study programming languages and type theories through the lens of category theory. While I am
broadly interested in these subjects, my research is focused on dependent type theory and more
specifically on modal or homotopy type theory. For instance, I am interested in the following
research topics:

 - Applications of modal type theory to synthetic (∞,1)-category theory
 - Using categorical methods to analyze different modal type theories
 - Using guarded dependent type theories to study denotational semantics
 - Using categorical logic to improve and refine program logics such as
   [Iris](http://iris-project.org)

If you are interested in collaborating on these questions or if you are a student interested in
pursuing an internship or Ph.D. with me, I encourage you to send me an email.

## Forthcoming book

[Carlo Angiuli](https://carloangiuli.com/) and I are writing a book on dependent type theory. An
early draft is available here: [Principles of Dependent Type
Theory](./papers/type-theory-book.pdf). Please feel free to contact me if you find any errors
(typographical or otherwise).
